        echo "The room was small, dimly lit by a flickering bulb hanging from the ceiling. White walls surrounded her, peeling and cracked as if they had been neglected for years. The air was thick with dust, and a faint, musty scent lingered in the silence. Every detail—the worn wooden floor, the faded curtains, and the crumbling wallpaper—felt unnervingly familiar.
        
        Emily sat on the edge of a threadbare mattress in the center of the room, her hands trembling as she tried to piece together what was happening. The last thing she remembered was walking down a narrow street, following a mysterious figure who had called out to her. Now, she was here—alone, in a room that seemed like a distorted reflection of her childhood.
        
        This room was eerily similar to her old daycare. The walls held memories she couldn’t quite reach, like they were layered with fragments of her past, ones she had long forgotten. She could almost hear the laughter of children, the gentle hum of toys, and the soft lullabies sung by caretakers. But those moments were hazy, distorted, as if they belonged to a dream—and this place felt like a nightmare.
        
        The unsettling familiarity grew more intense with every passing second. Shadows twisted in the corners, moving in ways they shouldn’t. A child’s laughter echoed faintly in the distance, followed by the sound of distant crying. Emily’s breath caught in her throat, her heart pounding as she looked around. She felt trapped—not in a physical sense, but in a memory she couldn’t escape.
        
        Her fingers traced the worn, faded wallpaper, and suddenly, an image flashed in her mind—a familiar figure of a woman with kind eyes and a soft voice, a caretaker she once knew. But the image warped, and her face twisted into something darker, something cold and hollow. The room seemed to grow smaller, the walls pressing in, suffocating her.
        
        The clock on the wall ticked louder and louder, echoing like a heartbeat. Time felt warped, as though the room had its own rhythm—an endless cycle she couldn’t break free from. She shouted, begged for answers, but her voice only seemed to fade into the void. The more she struggled, the more it felt like the room consumed her, pulling her deeper into its unsettling embrace.
        
        Tears welled in Emily’s eyes as the weight of her past became unbearable. She remembered fragments—a little girl sitting alone in a corner, a broken toy in her lap, the warmth of a caretaker’s hand that never reached her. The abandonment she had long pushed away surged back, drowning her in sorrow and fear.
        
        Night fell, but the room never darkened completely. Shadows still crept through the corners, always watching, always lingering. Emily cried softly, a quiet sob that echoed back at her from the empty walls. The room had become a prison, a twisted reflection of a place that should have been a sanctuary—a daycare that was once her safe haven, but now only served as a haunting, endless loop of isolation and loss.";
